# CS201Project

read file line by line, split info up by tabs and create nodes out of them which I then inserted into BST.
BST would then be balanced into an AVL tree through right/left rotations whenever necessary until tree was populated 
and balanced  
Afterwards user could create a file, delete a file, retrieve a file, and add or delete movies
from a file.
