Unfinished.

Idea was to read file line by line, split info up by tabs and create nodes out of them which I then inserted into BST.
BST would then be balanced into an AVL tree through right/left rotations whenever necessary until tree was populated 
and balanced (tree was built successfully, rotations did not always work as expected on LR and RL cases - no idea why). 
Afterwards user could create a file (finished), delete a file (finished), retrieve a file (finished), and add or delete movies
from a file (unfinished due to not being able to properly implement search function).
